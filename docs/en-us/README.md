Flower is a reactive programming framework based on Akka. To create a reactive system with Flower, developers just need to create a service for each business requirement and build service flows based on the business flow with self-explanatory configuration files.  


* Immediate response: The calling service will receive the response immediately, no need to wait for the whole flow to execute. No more synchronous calls.
* Robust: Self-recover when during service crush or hardware failure.
* Scalable: Auto scale based on load. Control request accepting rate based on system processing power.    
* Message-drive: Services communicate via messages. No coupling between services except the message itself: the previous service's return value must be the next service's input. Flower will encapsulate the return value into a message and sent it to the next service. 

**Flower is both a reactive programming framework, and a distributed micro-services framework**

**Flower hides the complicity of implementing reactive system**
